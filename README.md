# the babyBear 3D Printer
## A very small 3D printer! that slightly smaller than an A4 paper including a spool of filament.

Just the footprint is small. It has a 160mm diameter build plate and up to 300mm work height.
It's a complete 3D printer with quick change tool head. So the plan is making it a laser cutter and cnc milling machine along with printing.

```diff
+ All STL and BOM files have been updated.

! See the assembly animations on this link : https://kadirilkimen.com/babybear/assemblyanimations/
! Note that the animations are not final and not covers all the machine yet.

# Marlin now has Polar kinematics!
Finally, I developed polar kinematics and the Marlin team merged it to the main distribution.
That means you can just slice the model and send to the babyBear without post processing.

## Great people who helped me on this project.

Most of the babyBear components donated by V-slot Poland.

Filaments and some local logistics provided by RE3D filaments.
